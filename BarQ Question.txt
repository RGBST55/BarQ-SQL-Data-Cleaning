BarQ operates a chain of bar kiosks in airports, railway and bus stations. Every BarQ provides limited seating and offers a menu of beverages (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) 
and simple food items (both hot and cold). Each BarQ has a small kitchen that usually serves from 5pm to 2 am. BarQ has been fairly successful so far, but their new senior leadership 
team is looking to become data driven: decisions should be based on data and analytics rather than gut feel. As such, they have installed a point-of-sales (POS) system across all 
their bar kiosks in order to capture data, but are struggling to make sense of it and how to use it. They need your help. ​


​You will find 2 pages of sample transaction records enclosed that BarQ has provided at the end of the PowerPoint presentation. One page contains samples of transaction headers, while 
the other contains samples of transaction details. Additionally, two CSV files with two years of transactional data are included in the interview package as well. Please refer to the 
data dictionary for the data structure and field definitions.
